# Guilded furrybot
A guilded userbot that will automatically edit your messages to make you sound like a furry.
Why? I don't know.

# Setup
1: Put your guilded login in config.json\
2: Open run.bat

# Requirements
This uses [guilded.py](https://github.com/shayypy/guilded.py), buuuuuut since the pypi release (1.0.0 alpha & 0.0.5 in my tests) are broken this repository has the developer version packaged with it.\
And, according to guilded.py's setup.py, all it needs is aiohttp (pip install aiohttp).
